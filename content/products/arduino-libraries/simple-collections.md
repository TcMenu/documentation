# SimpleCollections - Summary

Simple collections provides a binary search based list and also a circular buffer that work over a wide range of devices, including Uno. This allows TcMenu and IoAbstraction to use this collection support even when running on an Uno board! Currently, most of the documentation is on GitHub and the reference docs are also  linked below. 

 * [Read the reference documentation](/ref-docs/simple-collections/html/index.html)
 * [Using btree list]({{< relref "simple-collection-btree.md" >}})
 * [Using thread-safe circular buffers]({{< relref "thread-safe-circular-buffer-collection.md" >}})
 * [Go to the code repo on github](https://github.com/davetcc/SimpleCollections/)
