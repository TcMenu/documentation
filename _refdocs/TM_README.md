## Summary 

TaskManagerIO is a task scheduling and eventing library for Arduino and mbed. It provides a very simple co-operative coroutines implementation. Along with working on a wide range of Arduino devices, it can also run on top of an RTOS such as ESP32 RTOS or mbed 6 RTOS, as most operations are thread safe.

For users of the library, the classes of interest are:

* TaskManager
* BaseEvent
* Executable
* ExecWithParameter.  

## Installing TaskManagerIO

The easiest way to install TaskMangerIO is using the library manager included with your Arduino / PlatformIO or other IDE.
