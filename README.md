# libraryDocs
This contains the library docs as they exist on theCodersCorner website.

This is completely self-contained and can be tested and developed locally with any recent build of hugo https://gohugo.io/

make sure when testing locally that in `config.toml` the `Production` parameter is 'N'. 

To test the site, simply start hugo in development mode from this directory with `hugo -w server`. That's it.
